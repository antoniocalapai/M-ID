# M-ID: Macaque Identification Suite

## Overview
M-ID is an integrated suite of tools designed for the identification, labeling, and analysis of macaque monkeys. It offers a main GUI application that integrates four key services: labeling, identify, design, and test interfaces, utilizing PyQt for an intuitive user experience. This suite supports researchers in wildlife biology and conservation by providing advanced machine learning tools for studying macaque populations.

## Features
- **Labeling Interface**: Tag images with identity labels for training machine learning models.
- **Identify Interface**: Load images, select models, and run batch processing for identification.
- **Design Interface**: Design and train new models, adaptable for various identification needs.
- **Test Interface**: Conduct experiments and tests to evaluate model performance and the impact of image modifications.

## Getting Started
